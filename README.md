## tm2 -TimeManagement 2
 A complete rewrite of TM to follow FP/OOP hybrid paradigm
## Abstract
Calendars and related programs never offered the level of control and functionality that I needed, so I made my own project. The source code and the program is completely free to use under GNU GPLv3.
## Help
#### Where future commands are documented...
## Authors
This original program (tm2) is completely written by @Scolopendria.
